                <p class="intro">A brilliantly written story of a man who needs to risk death to feel fully alive.</p>
                <p>A man who turns away from a comfortable, outwardly successful life toward dangerous pleasures.</p>
                <p>Michael Storr's joy comes from physical danger as a parachutist, a surfer, a hang glider, a free faller, a reckless skier.</p>
                <p>Oppressed by his life in New York City, he feels choked by his career as an executive in a high powered office,</p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;choked by the airless world of air conditioned towers.</p>
                <p>His own sanity depends on his finding a purer, simpler, more vigorous existence.</p>
                <p>He sets out to search for one, even though he loses his wife in the process.</p>
                <p>He finds the physical excitement he craves but along with it developments he has not contempated.</p>
                <p>For some of the personal relationships in which he becomes entangled prove as threatening as the most dangerous of his sports.</p>
